Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

X <- rbind(x_train, x_test)  -is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y <- rbind(y_train, y_test)  -is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test)  -is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data <- cbind(Subject, Y, X)  -is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function




Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

# selects from merge data only columns subject code and anything with mean and std in name

Q2<- select(Merged_Data,subject, code, contains("mean"), contains("std"))
(10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements 
on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

# Uses descriptive activity names  in the data set from activities file.

Q2$code<- activities[Q2$code, 2]

#fix label names

All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalData "Q5" (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing Q2 data taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalData into Q5.txt file.
